Banking Management App
Project Description :

Domain:
 Customers can conveniently do their daily banking in easy ways through our bank's online system, eliminating the need to visit the bank personally.

Objective:
  - To give clients a user-friendly interface
  - To give clients access to online banking over the internet and other telecommunications networks.
  - Customers can use this application to access their bank accounts and conduct various financial
  activities from anywhere in the world.

Brief description:
    The online banking system is being developed using an object-oriented language - java. The system will allow the user to access his/her bank account and carry out financial
 transactions using the internet along with other services that are offered and are described below.
  It will permit the users to pay their bills, transfer money from one account to another and also use the money transfer service such as Make payment.
 Over this, the user can also check the existing balance in his account. For users to enjoy this service they will have to open an account with the bank (if they don't have one),
 and all they have to do is set up their online account by setting their login credentials.
  
  ● Setting up and editing personal profile and account 
  
  ● Transfer funds 
  
  ● Make Payments
  
  ● Checking existing balance and recent transactions 

Modeling Tools: we used the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to create use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams to model the system's behavior and interactions. Also we used netbeans for most of our coding.

Language: Java for the back-end and Java Swing for the front-end. We chose MYSQL for database management, retrieving and storing client information, to guarantee the application's security and dependability.
